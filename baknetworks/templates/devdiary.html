                    <p><strong>29/06/2020</strong></p>
         
                    <p>Having achieved a BA in Music, Multimedia, and Electrical Engineering in 2012, I was eager to pursue a career in embedded systems or software development. What felt like hundreds of job applications, and subsequent interviews, over the course of six months all came down to the all too familiar <em>“lack of experience”</em>.  I eventually took to an admin job at a Building Society, as a steppingstone and to make ends meet. 8 years later I’m self-employed, and having progressed through administration, case handling, quality assurance, I’m currently a specialist intermediary between the Building Society and the Financial Ombudsman Service. But my interest in technology, logic, problem solving, and development has never stopped thriving.</p> 

                    <p>For Christmas in 2018, my brother would only give me my Christmas present on the proviso that I could solve a mathematical logic problem.  He gave me an email address, and that the gift was on the email account. I just had to guess the password, using python, with the following hint: </p>
                    
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
    print("My password is the first prime number which contains at least 5 sevens...") 
                    </pre>

                    <p>While I’d never used python before, having had more experience in C than anything else, I was excited to be set a task that required learning the syntax of a new language, and I didn’t realise just how much this would reignite my passion for programming.</p>
                    
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
    flag = False
    primeFlag = 0
    z = 10000000000000000
    x = 0
    y = 700000
    n = 0
    counter = 0

    while (flag == False):

    primeFlag = 0
    for i in range (2, y):
        if (y % i) == 0:
            primeFlag = primeFlag +1  
            if (primeFlag >0):
                break
        
    if (primeFlag == 0):
        print (str(y)+ " - Prime")
        for s in list(str(y)):
            if (s == "7"):
                counter = (counter + 1)

        if (counter == 5):
            print (str(y)+ " is the first prime number with at least 5 7's in!")
            flag = True
            exit()
        
        else:
            flag = False
            y = (y+1)
            counter = 0            

    else:
        y = (y+1)</pre>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
    727777 is the first prime number with at least 5 7's in!</pre>

                    <p>While it had taken me all of Christmas day, cornered in the conservatory being force fed mince pies and cider, I’d finally done it. And got access to an email address containing multiple CD keys for games. But the truth of the matter was that the real gift my brother had given me was the reignition for my love of programming and problem solving.</p> 
                    
                    <p>In September 2019, my wife reduced her hours at work and took on the LPC (Legal Practice Course) full time. Alongside her, while still working full time, I decided to start from the ground up and enrolled in Harvard’s CS50 – Introduction to Computer Science. On Christmas Eve, 2019, I submitted my final project for CS50 – <a href="https://github.com/BAK2K3/CSRPG" target="_blank">CS50RPG</a>, and subsequently received my verified EdX certificate.</p>

                    
                    <p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='cs50.jpg')}}"  class="img-fluid text-center"></p>
                     
                    
                    <p>Having explored python in much more depth in CS50, I knew this was my language of choice going forward. So, in January 2020, I started a course on Udemy for Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning. The course included topics on statistics that were far beyond the scope of my mathematical capabilities, so between January and March, the majority of the time that I spent studying for this course was reading <a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/" target="_blank"> An Introduction to Statistical Learning </a>.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Then lockdown hit. In April 2020, the contract I was on was suspended, and I was furloughed indefinitely. This was the best time for me to completely focus on furthering my knowledge, completing as many courses as I could, and building a portfolio to demonstrate my capabilities. My wife was still completing her LPC, so together we spent over 3 months studying 7 days a week.  Shortly into the lockdown, I completed the Data Science and Machine Learning course.</p> 

                    
                    <p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='datascience.jpg')}}"  class="img-fluid text-center"></p>
                    
                    <p>One of the final chapters in this course covered Neural Networks with TensorFlow, and I found myself enthralled with the topic, and spent a lot of time experimenting with the small areas covered during the course and externally researching wider concepts. Given my interest in Neural Networks, I decided to enrol in a course specifically for Deep Neural Networks with TensorFlow.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Within a month I’d completed the course, and one of the final aspects was deploying a simple Neural Network via Flask. I remember thinking – <em>"This would be a great way of showcasing what I’ve learnt."</em> But with such a shallow knowledge of web design and full stack development, I thought it would be beneficial to take an additional course on Flask, and web design, to really make the most out of the experience and to present the best possible user experience as part of my portfolio.</p>

                    <p>The final course, which I completed at the beginning of June 2020, was exactly that. A Python and Flask bootcamp for web development. Armed with what I thought was a sufficient arsenal to deploy my first project to the web, a stateful Recurrent Neural Network for Natural Language Processing, I started work on the portfolio, thinking <em>"This won't be too difficult, surely?”</em></p>

          <p><strong>01/07/2020</strong></p>

          <p><em>TL;DR – Deploying a stateful Neural Network was indeed, extremely difficult.</em>T</p> 

          <p>When initially planning my portfolio, I had huge prospects for what I wanted to demonstrate; most importantly, I’d hoped all my Neural Networks would be interactive in order for users to understand their application. The scope of my portfolio included Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks. All of which, I wanted to be interactive. </p>
          
          <p>The first fully developed Network I’d created through the TensorFlow course which was accessible, relatable, and interactive, was a <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation' target="_blank">“Shakespeare Bot”</a>. Given the simple and available nature of this model, I attempted a much “deeper” network using Tolstoy’s War and Peace, and named is “Tolstoybot”. Both of these were ready prior to starting the development of the website, and so deploying these models seemed the best place to start. </p>
          
          <p>The website started off simple, with a welcome page, and a separate page for the bots. I tested them out locally on Flask, and they seemed to work out of the box. The model was hosted locally on my computer, as part of the website, and the function for obtaining predicted text worked as intended:</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">         
  #Test function for generating consecutive text
  def generate_text(model,start_seed,num_generate=500,temperature=1):
      
      #Map each character in start_seed to it's relative index
      input_eval = [char_to_ind[s] for s in start_seed]
      
      #Expand the dimensions
      input_eval = tf.expand_dims(input_eval, 0)
      
      #Create empty list for generated text
      text_generated = []
      
      #Reset the states of the model        
      model.reset_states()
      
      #for each iteration of num_generate
      for i in range(num_generate):
          
          #Obtain probability matrix for current iteration 
          predictions = model(input_eval)
          
          #Reduce dimensions
          predictions = tf.squeeze(predictions,0)
          
          #Multiply probability matrix by temperature
          predictions = predictions/temperature
          
          #Select a random outcome, based on the unnormalised log-probabilities produced by the model
          predicted_id = tf.random.categorical(predictions, num_samples=1)[-1,0].numpy()
          
          #Expand dimensions of prediction and assign as next input evaluation
          input_eval = tf.expand_dims([predicted_id], 0)
          
          #Convert prediction to char and append to generated list of text
          text_generated.append(ind_to_char[predicted_id])
          
      #return the initial input, concatenated with the generated text. 
      return(start_seed+"".join(text_generated))</pre>
          
          <p>Feeling like I was ready to conquer the world, I set up an account on Heroku, made a new application, and pushed my git to the Heroku master channel.</p> 
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  Compiled slug size: 750M is too large (max is 500M)</pre>

          <p><strong>Oh.</strong> So it turns out that TensorFlow is too big for Heroku. Given showcasing my capabilities with TensorFlow was one of the most important intentions of the portfolio, I’d immediately hit a brick wall. I needed to research workarounds to the size of TensorFlow, and how to deploy these via Flask and Heroku. <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/lite' target="_blank">TFLite</a> was one of the first solutions I’d found for a more portable version of TensorFlow, but this is primarily designed for mobile applications by the looks of things, so was outside of the scope of what I was currently capable of doing. After a little while I stumbled upon a conference talk by a Google employee, about <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mqFDwIdKh0' target="_blank">TensorFlow Serving</a>. The initial discussion of <em>containers</em> and <em>docker</em> was a little overwhelming, but the pure concept of it was amazing. Essentially, you deploy the model to a container, and use REST API to communicate with the container (i.e send input, receive output). This solution would potentially allow me to completely remove TensorFlow from my python environment, and would therefore substantially reduce the slug size permitted by Heroku. Let’s give it a whirl.</p> 
          
          <p>I took a little tutorial on Docker, enabled virtualisation on my Windows based computer, installed Windows Subsystem for Linux, finished the <em>“getting started”</em> Docker exercise and I was ready to go.   After a couple of runs of trial and error, I’d managed to locally host two models in the same container.</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  model_config_list {
      config {
          name: "shakesbot",
          base_path: "/models/shakesbot",
          model_platform: "tensorflow"
      }
      config {
          name: "tolstoybot",
          base_path: "/models/tolstoybot",
          model_platform: "tensorflow"
      }
  }</pre>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
  docker run -p 8501:8501 -p 8500:8500`
  --mount type=bind,source='{PATH}\Saved_Models\Shakesbot',target=/models/shakesbot/1 
  --mount type=bind,source='{PATH}\Saved_Models\Tolstoybot',target=/models/tolstoybot/1 
  --mount type=bind,source='{PATH}\model_config.config',target=/models/model_config.config 
  -t tensorflow/serving 
  --model_config_file=/models/model_config.config</pre>
          
          <p>With the model now hosted on a container, albeit locally, I needed to rewrite my function to work with RESTful communication between the website and the container.</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  #Create REST Function for Docker Container
  def generate_text_JSON(start_seed,num_generate=500,temperature=1):
        
      #Map each character in start_seed to it's relative index
      input_eval = [char_to_ind[s] for s in start_seed]
      
      #Expand the dimensions
      input_eval = tf.expand_dims(input_eval, 0)
        
      #Create empty list for generated text
      text_generated = []
      
      #Define headers for RESTful communication
      headers = {"content-type": "application/json"}
      
      #Commented out, as the model is no longer being passed as a parameter  
      #model.reset_states()
      
      for i in range(num_generate):
          
          #Package the current iteration into an iterable json data dump
          data = json.dumps({"signature_name": "serving_default", "instances": input_eval.numpy().tolist()})
          
          #Obtain response from container through RESTful communication 
          json_response = requests.post('http://localhost:8501/v1/models/shakesbot:predict',data=data, headers=headers)
          
          #Extract probability matrix for current iteration from Json response
          predictions = json.loads(json_response.text)
                  
          #Reduce dimensions
          predictions = tf.squeeze(predictions['predictions'],0)
          
          #Multiply probabily matrix by temperature
          predictions = predictions/temperature
          
          #Select a random outcome, based on the unnormalised log-probabilities produced by the model
          predicted_id = tf.random.categorical(predictions, num_samples=1)[-1,0].numpy()
          
          #Expand dimensions of prediction and assign as next input evaluation
          input_eval = tf.expand_dims([predicted_id], 0)
          
          #Convert prediction to char and append to generated list of text
          text_generated.append(ind_to_char[predicted_id])
          
      #return the initial input, concatenated with the generated text. 
      return(start_seed+"".join(text_generated))</pre>

          <p>This took a great deal of work: learning about REST APIs, RESTful communication, JSON formatted data, deciphering and fully understanding the context of the initial function, and plenty of assistance from the trusty StackOverflow. But I’d overcome this hurdle. I was now locally hosting two aspects of the portfolio separately.</p>
          
          <p>Looking back at the function I’d created to generate text, though, I realised that there were a handful of functions which were inherited from TensorFlow. Given the nature of the transition from TensorFlow to TensorFlow Serving, I needed to try and remove all reference to TensorFlow within this function in order to push an environment to Heroku without TensorFlow being part of it. These were the functions that needed changing:</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  #Dimension Expansion
  tf.expand_dims

  #Dimension Reduction 
  tf.squeeze

  #Randomly selecting an outcome based on unnormalized log-probabilities 
  tf.random.categorical</pre>
          
          <p>The first two were straightforward with near identical NumPy functions:</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  #Dimension Expansion
  np.expand_dims

  #Dimension Reduction 
  np.squeeze</pre>
          
          
          <p>The next function, for random selection based on unnormalized log-probabilities, resulting in me going back the drawing board of understanding some fundamentals of statistics and probabilities. In an ideal world, NumPy would have an inbuilt function similar to Dimension Expansion and Reduction, but unfortunately the implementation of such a feature wasn’t considered a priority due to it’s <a href='https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15201?fbclid=IwAR04s9NppTpPZjYNnX2_nPJuGSxUgrGT5tPZ8GAL7bNUoMBdI5H_OnOOGxc' target="_blank">niche nature</a>. The closest function I could find was:</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  np.random.choice</pre>

          <p>However, the probability distributions had to be normalised, and have a sum of 1. With some mathematical assistance of my aforementioned brother, I was able to perform such a transformation on the probability matrix using the following simple function:</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  #Function for calculating the exponential of the array, and normalising probability distribution
  def exp_normalize(x):
      y = np.exp(x)
      return y / y.sum()</pre>

          <p>Then, when making the random selection within the function, I could call the following:</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  #Select a random outcome, based on the unnormalised log-probabilities produced by the model
  predicted_id = np.random.choice(vocab_size, p=exp_normalize(predictions))</pre>
          
          <p>And voila, I’d done it. The function for generating text from the model no longer required TensorFlow, and I was one step closer to being able to deploy the initial concept for the portfolio. I ported all of the code over to Flask, however as I was cleaning it up and removing any redundancies, I came across one of the functions I’d initially commented out when first attempting RESTful communication to the containerised model.</p>
  
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  #resetting the internal states of the model  
  #model.reset_states()</pre>

          <p><em>So close, yet so far.</em> Let’s quickly discuss Recurrent Neural Networks, and what it means for them to be stateful. The nature of RNNs is that they retain information from their previous calculations, allowing their outputs to be impacted by previous inputs. That’s how they’re recurrent. So for example if I were to input a start seed of “He”, the model will be more likely to subsequently produce male orientated language, given the probabilities going forward will be biased towards male contextualised language. On this basis, from the first function detailed above, before making any new predictions/generations of text, the models states need to be “reset”, so that it has no prior influence or retained knowledge of any previous predictions. The ability to reset a model’s states in between predictions was a fundamental necessity, and without the ability to do this, the internal states would continue to stack, and would no longer accurately represent the individual context of each prediction.</p>
          
          <p>Given TensorFlow Serving uses RESTful communication, it is extremely limited in the instructions that can be sent and received via models being served on a container. In essence, out of the box TF Serving only allows the request for a “prediction” based on an input; without any extensive knowledge TF Serving’s infrastructure, given it’s extensive <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/serving/server-core' target="_blank">API Docs</a>, there was no easy solution to this. I’d found a feature request <a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/issues/724' target="_blank">from 2018</a> which had little traction, with the only real solution or suggestion being to build a custom binary for TF Serving’s ServerCore. I took to <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/tensorflow/comments/hfhwwm/how_to_reset_rnn_model_states_of_a_model_being/' target="_blank">Reddit</a>, and I took to <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62570483/how-to-reset-rnn-model-states-of-a-model-being-served-on-docker' target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>, but to no avail.</p> 
          
          <p>I had to accept defeat. I was now treading in the deep waters of the unknown and came to the conclusion that whilst this is an extremely exciting and interesting development in terms of deploying Neural Networks for production, I wasn’t yet capable of embarking on this journey. I had to scrap the idea of using TensorFlow Serving, and I had to find an alternative solution.</p>
          
          <p>Whilst doing my initial research into overcoming the issue with the slug size for Heroku, I came across an alternative build of TensorFlow which only utilises the CPU. Given all the models I’d previously made were trained via a CUDA GPU (NVidia 1080Ti), I was hesitant to try and deploy a model which only utilises a CPU, given the training times themselves went from 60 seconds per epoch to 15 minutes per epoch when swapping between GPU and CPU. But at this stage, I felt like I was moving in reverse, and decided that functionality was a priority over performance.</p> 
          
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  Warning: Your slug size (406 MB) exceeds our soft limit (300 MB) which may affect boot time.</pre>

          <p>While the prospect of a slow performing Neural Network was diminishing my excitement for the finished product, the above warning when deploying the environment to Heroku with TensorFlow-CPU was music to my ears. The models were finally functional, and were deployed online. The Shakesbot had an approximate return time of 6 seconds, and the Tolstoybot had an approximate return time of 15 seconds. Ultimately, while this is significantly slower than when running locally on a GPU based environment (1 second and 3 seconds respectively), the realisation dawned on me that the functionality was absolutely a priority, and that improvements could no doubt be made down the line to improve the performance if need be. </p>
